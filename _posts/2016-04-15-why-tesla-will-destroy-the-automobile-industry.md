  If there's an example of a company about to disruptively innovate an entire
  industry, it's Tesla. Partly, this is because of raw technology--Tesla's is
  clearly superior to that of its competitors. Partly, it's because Tesla has a
  more efficient business model. As Slate recently pointed out, Tesla bypasses
  value-subtracting dealer franchises and universally disliked car salespeople.
